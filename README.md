#### Overview

**Game Dev Unit (GDSC)** is a creative and technical community of passionate students and developers dedicated to exploring the world of **game development and interactive design**. The club provides a collaborative space where members can learn, build, and share knowledge about creating games using modern tools and technologies such as **Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender, and Godot**.

At GDSC, we believe that games are more than just entertainment — they are a form of art, storytelling, and innovation. Our members work together on projects that blend **creativity, programming, 3D modeling, animation, and sound design** to bring ideas to life.

Through **workshops, hackathons, tutorials, and collaborative projects**, the Game Dev Unit helps members develop skills in:

* **Game design & mechanics**
* **Programming (C#, C++, Python, GDScript)**
* **3D modeling and animation**
* **Pixel art and asset creation**
* **UI/UX for games**
* **Publishing and marketing indie games**

The club also partners with the **Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC)** network, connecting members to a global community of developers and innovators. This collaboration gives our members the opportunity to access real-world mentorship, participate in global challenges, and showcase their creations to the world.

Whether you’re a **beginner** curious about how games are made or an **experienced developer** looking to collaborate on ambitious projects, **Game Dev Unit (GDSC)** is the place where imagination meets technology.
