**FPS Parkour**
Momentum, Movement & Level Design
🎯 Objective

Create a first-person parkour game where the fun comes from movement and level design, not combat.

This challenge evaluates:

FPS movement systems

Physics-based mechanics

Intentional level design

Code structure & iteration

🎮 Core Game Concept

The player completes movement-focused levels using speed, flow, and precision.

Combat is optional.
Movement mastery is mandatory.

✅ Mandatory Gameplay Features
1️⃣ Core FPS Movement (Required 🔴)

Mouse look

WASD movement

Jump with air control

Momentum preservation

Movement must feel smooth and responsive.

2️⃣ Parkour Mechanics (Required 🔴)

You must implement at least 3 of the following:

Wall running

Sliding (momentum-based)

Wall jumping

Vaulting

Ledge grabbing

Grapple hook

Each mechanic must:

Have clear entry/exit conditions

Preserve or modify momentum intentionally

Be reusable across levels

3️⃣ Level Design Focus 

You must create 2–4 handcrafted levels designed around:

Teaching mechanics naturally

Flow and movement lines

Risk vs reward paths

Skill expression

Each level must include:

A clear start & end

Multiple possible routes (fast vs safe)

Visual guidance (lighting, geometry, color)

Procedual levels are allowed

4️⃣ Time / Score System

Level completion time OR

Speed-based scoring system

Persistent best time / score per level

This encourages replayability and mastery.

5️⃣ Checkpoints & Restart

Mid-level checkpoints

Instant restart

No long reload times

🎨 Creativity & Design Depth

Your game must have a strong identity:
You can use any theme of your choice

🧩 Code Architecture Requirements

You must demonstrate:

Modular movement system

Clear separation:

Input

Movement logic

Camera

UI

Minimal hard-coding

Suggested components:

PlayerController

MovementStateMachine

LevelManager

CheckpointSystem

TimeTrialManager
